	<center><h3><u>Brief Summary</u></h3></center>
	Through HIMYM's 9 seasons Ted has many relationships with girls in New York City, but ultimately 
	breaks them all off in an attempt to date Robin (one of his best friends).  Robin eventually ends up with Barney (another of Ted's best friends).  
	The show skims over the awkardness of the <mark>Ted/Barney/Robin friendship</mark>.  Lily and Marshall are the stable couple of the group and provide 
	a stark contrast to Barney who seduces a different girl every night.
	
	<br><br>
	The whole show is Ted telling a story so it is one big flash back, but each episode flashbacks within the overarching flashbacks.  During each 
	episode the directors twisted the timeline of the flashbacks creating new ways to tell stories.  This way of story telling kept the show interesting
	and refreshing.
